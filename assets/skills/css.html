	I still remember when I was first learning CSS...
	<ul>
		<li>What on earth is the box model?</li>
		<li>How do I vertically align my content?</li>
		<li>HOW DO I MAKE ANYTHING ON THIS SITE LOOK NICE?!? AARRGGHHHH</li>
	</ul>
	Fortunately I spent four months last year working as a full stack developer for a startup known as Ticketfi. I worked on a TON of UI/UX related development and even ended up being in charge of designing a new homepage in order to increase sales. Now I finally feel as if I have a pretty solid understanding of on CSS. Despite all it's quirks, it is actually not a bad language to work with once you get the hang of it!

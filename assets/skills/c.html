	Did someone say speed? Because my C code just executed faster than Paul Walker driving in Fast & Furious. We’re going mach speed baby.

	And now you have my best description of how it feels to write C code. Although it generally takes me longer to write my programs, I love writing C or C++ because when the code finally executes you can almost feel the adrenaline rushing through you. In terms of experience, C++ was actually one of my first programming languages I ever learned back in high school. Nowadays I often use C++ on <a class="link" href='https://www.hackerrank.com/blakebrown' target="_blank">HackerRank</a> when I enter in competitive programming contests. I’m also using it for my Data Structures & Algorithms course at university.

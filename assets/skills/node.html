	Guess what the backend of this site is using? You guessed it! Node.js, Express and a small dose of Nginx to act as a reverse proxy so that you don't need to type :3000 after the URL. Don't you feel hipster already? :) I would be lying if I said I wasn't a huge fan of Node. Although writing asynchronous code can have a few "gotchas", the backend makes perfect sense when it comes to the event loop and how Node handles incoming requests. Rather than using a series of threads & processes to handle incoming HTTP requests, callbacks allow for Node.js to handle everything on a single thread which can scale up to thousands of concurrent requests at a time. Now tell me that isn't cool. Especially when most of our HTTP requests are really just database queries or file I/O, Node.js makes complete sense as a modern backend. I've worked a lot with Node.js and Express at my most recent co-op job as well as in many of my side projects.

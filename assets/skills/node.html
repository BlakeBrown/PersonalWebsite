	Guess what the backend of this site is using? You guessed it! Node.js, Express and a small dose of Nginx to act as a reverse proxy so that you don't need to type :3000 after the URL. Don't you feel hipster already?

	I love how Node.js can scale up to thousands of concurrent requests at a time by using it's concept of an "event loop". As long as the backend is only responsible for doing database queries, file I/O and not synchronous code or intense calculations then it generally holds up pretty well. I worked a lot with Node.js + Express while I was at Genesys as well as in my personal side projects.

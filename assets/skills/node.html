	Guess what the backend of this site is using? You guessed it! Node.js, Express and a small dose of Nginx to act as a reverse proxy so that you don't need to type :3000 after the URL. Don't you feel hipster already? :) Node.js is an amazing javascript runtime environment. Rather than using a series of threads & processes to handle incoming HTTP requests, Node.js handles everything on a single thread using callbacks and a concept known as the event loop which can scale up to thousands of concurrent requests at a time. Now tell me that isn't cool. Especially when most of our HTTP requests are just database queries or file I/O, Node.js makes complete sense as a modern framework. I've worked a lot with Node.js + Express at my most recent co-op job as well as in many of my side projects.

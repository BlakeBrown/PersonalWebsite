	Narrator: In the ever expanding world of mobile development, a growing startup was getting desperate for a developer who could help them expand. They were running out of rations, VC funding was at an all-time low. Even the marketing team was starting to lose hope. Everything seemed lost for the company, but that's when the CEO made an extraordinary decision. He decided to look out the window and that's when he saw something strange. In the midst of the crowd outside, stood a lone developer. He turned and held a keyboard high up into the air.

	<br>
	CEO: *GASP* Is that the legendary coder by the name of Sir Blakelock?
	<br>
	<br>
	CTO: I think it is my lord. Must we hire him to code amazing mobile apps for us?
	<br>
	<br>
	CEO: I think we must.
	<br>

	In case the story didn't suffice, I am really passionate about mobile development! :) I have lots of experience with Java from my first internship at TELUS Health as well as when I studied Android in my ECE155 course.

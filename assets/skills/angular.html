	I've had a lot of experience with AngularJS, however I am not the biggest fan of the framework. One of my biggest pet peeves with Angular is how quickly the frameworkâ€™s implementation of dirty checking can ruin performance in large web applications. When I worked at Genesys, there was an Angular app that was so slow it would occasionally hang the web browser. I found there was an excessive amount of redundant watch expressions, nested ng-repeats, lack of one-time data-bindings and more. In order to fix the offending code, I tried to use Angular best practices in addition to rewriting some of our core directives with jQuery. This lead to an impressive performance improvement of over 90% and my efforts were rewarded with an amazing reference letter at the end of my co-op :D You can check it out over at my <a class="link" href='https://ca.linkedin.com/in/blakebrown1995' target="_blank">LinkedIn page.</a>

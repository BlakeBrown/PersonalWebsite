<h3 id="skill-type">AngularJS</h3>
<p id="skill-description" class="description">
	Recently I’ve been getting pretty good experience with Angular, both at my most recent co-op job and in some web experiments I’ve worked in my free time. I have to admit, Angular is not my favourite front end framework. That being said, in some cases I have noticed in saves me a lot of time writing code that would have otherwise taken many more lines using pure javascript or jQuery. One of my biggest pet peeves with Angular is how quickly the framework’s implementation of dirty checking can become really inefficient. Fortunately, as long as you’re careful and write proper code it usually shouldn’t be too big of an issue. I was actually able to improve the performance of the application at my last co-op by over 90% using a few carefully considered techniques!

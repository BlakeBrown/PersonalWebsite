	I've had a lot of experience with AngularJS - I used it extensively at my most recent co-op job as well as in some web experiments that I work on in my free time. That being said, I am not the biggest fan of the framework. One of my biggest pet peeves with Angular is how quickly the frameworkâ€™s implementation of dirty checking can become inefficient in large web applications. The application at my last workplace suffered heavily performance-wise because of this - there were an excessive amount of complex watchers, nested ng-repeats, few instances in which one-time data-binding was being used, etc. Fortunately I was able to fix most of the offending code in only a few weeks by doing a ton of careful research and implementation of my ideas, which ended up leading to an impressive performance improvement of over 90%. My employer was so impressed that he ended up writing me an amazing reference letter which you can check out over at my <a class="link" href='https://ca.linkedin.com/in/blakebrown1995' target="_blank">LinkedIn page.</a>

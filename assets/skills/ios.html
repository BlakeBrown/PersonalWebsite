I've always wanted to get more into iOS development as it seems to be a really interesting field for software developers. Phones tend to have tons of hardware API's as opposed to web or desktop applications, which leaves the potential for <i>crazy</i> projects along modern graphics processing. I made my first iOS app at Waterloo's fall hackathon (Hack the North) and it was a blast working together with other mobile developers. I'm definitely looking to get back into iOS development soon, either for my next co-op job or side project.

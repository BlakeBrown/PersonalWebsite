iOS hype!!! I made my first iOS app at Waterloo's fall hackathon (Hack the North) and it was a blast getting to work with other mobile developers. Phones tend to have tons of hardware API's, which leaves the potential for some <i>crazy</i> side projects. I'm definitely looking to get back into iOS development soon, either for my next co-op job or side project.

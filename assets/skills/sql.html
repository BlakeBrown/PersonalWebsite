	Databases are cool. As a full stack developer, I’ve worked extensively with MySQL as well as PostgreSQL on several occasions. I can definitely write efficient queries when I need them, but know I still have some room for improvement since I haven’t had the opportunity to work on any huge backend optimization tasks yet. Also on my list to learn is Apache Cassandra, MongoDB and Redis. I am actually really hoping I can get a job as a backend developer in the near future, so if you're looking for a backend developer please consider hiring me!

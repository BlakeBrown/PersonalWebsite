	PHP is actually not a bad language in my opinion. It often gets a lot of flame in the developer community for being outdated, having poor documentation and its sometimes completely useless error messages (admittely I have run into this issue before), but in spite of it all I really don't mind working with PHP. Afterall, PHP was my very first web language back when I used to make Wordpress sites. I would use PHP to modify the plugins I was using on my site and add extra functionality such as custom login buttons, a subscription system, etc. Just last year I got a development job working for a startup called Ticketfi where we used Laravel 5 as our backend framework. I've had some fond memories with PHP and honestly as long as you're building your website with an appropriate PHP framework, I'd say it's not bad. Solid 7/10.

	I have pretty good experience coding with AngularJS - I’ve used it extensively at my most recent co-op job as well as in some web experiments that I work on in my free time. That being said, I am not the biggest fan of the framework. One of my biggest pet peeves with Angular is how quickly the framework’s implementation of dirty checking can become inefficient in large web applications. In fact the application at my last workplace suffered heavily performance-wise due to an excessive use of watchers, use of nested ng-repeats, not taking advantage of one-time data-binding, etc. Fortunately I was able to fix most of the offending code in only a few weeks by doing careful research and implementation, which lead to performance improvement of over 90%!

	PHP is actually not a bad language in my opinion. It often gets a lot of flame in the developer community for being outdated, having poor documentation and its sometimes completely useless error messages (I admittely have run into this issue before), but in spite of it all I really don't mind working with PHP. It was the very first backend language I learned, back in highschool when I used to make Wordpress sites. When I worked at Ticketfi for co-op, we used Laravel 5 (a PHP framework) for our entire backend. I've had some fond memories with the language and honestly as long as you're building your website with an appropriate framework, I'd say it's not bad. I'd give it a 7/10.

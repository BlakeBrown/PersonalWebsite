	Disclaimer â€“ I am a huge fan of jQuery!

	Even though jQuery is technically a library, it almost feels to me as if it should be called a framework. In my opinion it really is that crucial to web development since it provides so many incredibly intuitive and useful functions that can ultimately simplify a LOT of raw javascript code. Of course if you are using a framework like Angular then you will probably want to avoid writing too much jQuery since it will clutter up your javascript files, but for most other projects I almost always find jQuery is a good way to go.

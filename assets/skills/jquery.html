<h3 id="skill-type">jQuery</h3>
<p id="skill-description" class="description">
	This library is amazinggg! :) Even though jQuery is technically a library, I almost feel as if it should be called a framework simply because of how useful it can be. jQuery provides so many useful and intuitive functions that not only simplify a lot of raw javascript code, but can also speed up your workflow exponentially as you work with the DOM. Of course there are scenarios where writing excessive amounts of jQuery probably isn’t the best idea (if you’re using a framework like Angular for example), but for most projects I usually find jQuery is a fantastic library to include. Personally I’ve used it in many of my side projects as well as when I was working as a full-stack developer at Ticketfi.

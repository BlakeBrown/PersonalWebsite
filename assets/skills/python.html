	Python is an amazing language. I absolutely love its intuitive syntax and overall simplicity. I've seen Python being used everywhere from web (with frameworks like Django or Flask), to scientific computing and machine learning research. I think it’s pretty fascinating that such a simple scripting language is being used for so many different applications across the world. Python is my go-to language when I’m teaching others how to program and I also use it occasionally in competitive programming. Although python generally has slower runtimes than C, C++ or Java, it makes up for that by making it so much faster to write code.
